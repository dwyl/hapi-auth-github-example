basic example.

##Â How?

```js
link: '<https://api.github.com/user/issues?access_token=6b5b70cab3d6c7d2567f7c86700c2c0516482d14&page=2>; rel="next", <https://api.github.com/user/issues?access_token=6b5b70cab3d6c7d2567f7c86700c2c0516482d14&page=8>; rel="last"',

### Environment Variables

You will need to have the following environment vairables to run this example app:

```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YourGitHubClientIDE # see: http://git.io/vRthZ for full instructions
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=SuperSecret     # copy this from your GitHub App settings (see above)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000       # same as Authorized JavaScript Origin for your GitHub App
PORT=8000                            # the port on your local machine you want to run the app on
JWT_SECRET=SomethingSuperSecretive!  # a secret used to sign session tokens
```
